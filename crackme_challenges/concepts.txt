Radare2 
	-In radare2, a register was called [s]. ex. mov eax, dword [s]  -- confusing becuase i thought it was a string but its just a register named s 


LEA
	lea passes the memory address from the origin to the destination



loops in Radare2
	If vs. While Loop
		An If statement is a check without a loop while a while statement is a check with a loop
	
	The condition for a loop is in the box above the t/f


	

Using scanf with int is different than with char
