For Loop-Goodboy/badboy
	The Good boy/bad boy coming from the for loop confused me because i thought there would be an if statement before the for the loop. 
	In this particular case, False led to for loop and True led to printf( str.Password_Incorrect ).I realized that instead of an if statement, the printf existed inside the function and just outside the 	   for loop.
